c = b log2 (1 + s) //c:bps, b:Hz, s=SNR(dB)
TR.45820:Table 7.3.6.2-1:
Without IP header compression, the protocol overhead above (equivalent of) SNDCP layer is 65 bytes.
TR.45820: 6.2.6.15.2	Traffic Models Discussion:
For such UL traffic, the payload size follows a Pareto distribution with minimum and maximum payload sizes of 20 and 200 bytes, respectively.
Note that, for each payload there is a 65 bytes header overhead at the SNDCP layer as well as 15 bytes SNDCP to MAC overhead,
 i.e. each payload has an overhead of approximately 80 bytes at the MAC layer.
 Note that for MAR periodic reporting, approximately 6.81 reports per second per sector on average correspond to 52547 UEs per sector [6.2-20]
